# mathgames.win

Minimal React + Vite app that will serve as the game launcher for mathgames.win. The UI is currently a placeholder while the launcher experience is built out.

## Tech Stack
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- ESLint

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts
```bash
npm run dev      # start local dev server
npm run build    # typecheck + production build
npm run preview  # preview production build locally
npm run lint     # run ESLint
```

## Project Structure
- `src/App.tsx` main app component (currently placeholder UI)
- `public/` static assets
- `dist/` production build output (generated)

## Status
Game launcher UI coming next.
